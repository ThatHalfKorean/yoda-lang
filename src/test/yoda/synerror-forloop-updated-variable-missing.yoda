{x you print} as through 1 to x runs <(-_-)> Need to finish the range because x 
                                     <(-_-)> is determined as upper bound in this case
                                     <(-_-)> Should be "as through 1 to m x runs"
                                     <(-_-)> where m is just some number or variable reference
